# Histone-modifiers-of-protozoan-parasites
## Differential gene expression analysis
To get an insight into how parasites regulate their gene expression inside host to establish infection, we opt to look into expression level of histone-modifying enzymes which helps in the addition or removal of histone post-translational modifications which in turn regulates gene expression. For that, processed and normalized tanscriptomics data were obtained using GEO query package. GSE68667 was used for Plasmodium falciparum ; GSE32427 was used for Toxoplasma gondii; GSE21936 was used for Leishmania donovani; and GSE14641 for Trypanosoma cruzi. The histone modifying enzyme genes were sorted and the logFc value were used to prepare scatterplots using ggplot2 package to show differential expression of histone modifying enzyme genes throughout different life-cycle stages of respective parasites. 

## Contents
GSE14641_T.cruzi, GSE21936_L.donovani_L.infantum, GSE32427_T.gondii and GSE68667_P.falciparum contains results of transcriptome analysis of corresponding parasites. Merged folder contains excel sheets of all genes obtained after analysis and histone modifier genes of individual parasites; it also contains the merged histone modifiers scatterplots of all parasites that are significantly upregulated or downregulated in human host-residing life-cycle stage forms.
